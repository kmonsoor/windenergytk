# Introduction #

The Wind Energy Toolkit is a compilation of software tools aimed towards students. It
performs functions that relate to preliminary wind turbine design and analysis. It features
six core libraries that cover topics in wind data analysis, data synthesis, aerodynamics,
vibrations, electrodynamics and system performance. The code is designed to be used in
conjunction with a course using the text Wind Energy Explained by James Manwell, et.
al. This software is a Python port and hopefully advancement of the original Wind Energy
Engineering Toolkit that was written in Visual Basic.

# Components #
The toolkit is a Python package that includes modules for each group of codes. In addition, a rudimentary graphical interface is included but is currently under serious development.
